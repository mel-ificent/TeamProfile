## User-Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```
## Installation
This code requires the following to be installed:
- Node.js
- [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) to use provided test scripts

Note: consider creating a .gitignore file and include node_modules so that your node_modules directory is not tracked or uploaded to GitHub in the future. Be sure to create your. .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.


## Usage
To use this application, first run the command â€˜node index' to start the prompts.  Answer each prompt to create the team manager.  If a user enters a non-number for the Employee ID, the system will request you to re-enter the value.  If a user enters an invalid format for the email question, the system will request you to re-enter the value.

After the details for one team member have been completed, the system will ask whether you want to add another person (either an engineer or an intern).  If the user selects another team member, they will go through another series of prompts related to that employee type. Otherwise, the user has the option to complete the team creation process.

Once the user finishes creating their team, a new index.html file will be created under the 'dist' folder containing all the entered team members.
